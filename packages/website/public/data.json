            "description": "The Walt Disney Company, commonly just Disney (/ˈdɪzni/),[2] is an American multinational entertainment and media conglomerate headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios complex in Burbank, California.\nDisney was originally founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt and Roy O. Disney as the \"Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio\";[3] it also operated under the names \"The Walt Disney Studio\" and \"Walt Disney Productions\" before officially changing its name to The Walt Disney Company in 1986. The company established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and theme parks.\nSince the 1980s, Disney has created and acquired corporate divisions in order to market more mature content than is typically associated with its flagship family-oriented brands. The company is known for its film studio division, The Walt Disney Studios, which includes Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, 20th Century Animation, and Searchlight Pictures. Disney's other main business units include divisions in television, broadcasting, streaming media, theme park resorts, consumer products, publishing, and international operations. Through these various segments, Disney owns and operates the ABC broadcast network; cable television networks such as Disney Channel, ESPN, Freeform, FX, and National Geographic; publishing, merchandising, music, and theater divisions; direct-to-consumer streaming services such as Disney+, Star+, ESPN+, Hulu, and Hotstar; and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, a group of 14 theme parks, resort hotels, and cruise lines around the world.[4][5] Cartoon character Mickey Mouse, created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, serves as the company's official mascot.[6]\nThe company, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under DIS stock symbol,[7] has been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1991.[8] In August 2020, just under two-thirds of the stock was owned by large financial institutions.[9]\n",

            "description": "PepsiCo, Inc. is an American multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation headquartered in Harrison, New York, in the hamlet of Purchase. PepsiCo's business encompasses all aspects of the food and beverage market. It oversees the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of its products. PepsiCo was formed in 1965 with the merger of the Pepsi-Cola Company and Frito-Lay, Inc. PepsiCo has since expanded from its namesake product Pepsi Cola to an immensely diversified range of food and beverage brands. The largest and most recent acquisition was Tropicana Products in 1998 and the Quaker Oats Company in 2001, which added the Gatorade brand to the Pepsi portfolio.\nAs of January 2021, the company possesses 23 brands that have over $1 billion in sales.[2] Pepsico has operations all around the world and its products were distributed across more than 200 countries, resulting in annual net revenues of over $70 billion. Based on net revenue, profit, and market capitalization; PepsiCo is the second-largest food and beverage business in the world, behind Nestlé. PepsiCo's flagship product Pepsi Cola has been engaged in a rivalry for generations with Coca-Cola, commonly referred to as the Soda Wars. Despite Coca-Cola outselling Pepsi Cola in the United States, PepsiCo within the North American market is the largest food and beverage company by net revenue. Ramon Laguarta has been the chief executive of PepsiCo since 2018. The company's beverage distribution and bottling is conducted by PepsiCo as well as by licensed bottlers in certain regions.\nPepsi has been repeatedly criticized by environmentalists for its relationship to negative environmental impacts of agriculture in its supply chain, and distributing operations such as palm oil-related deforestation and pesticide use, its use of water resources, and the negative impacts of its packaging—Pepsi's packaging has consistently been one of the top sources of plastic pollution globally.[3]  Similarly public health advocates have criticized Pepsi's high-calorie, poor nutrition product lines along with other popular snack and drink manufacturers. In response, PepsiCo has made public comments on their commitment to minimizing their impact but has not released public information documenting progress on most of its public commitments.\n",
